## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- **uv** (fast Python package manager)
- A terminal emulator with TrueColor support (most modern terminals support this).


### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/m4cd4r4/textual-sticky-notes-tui.git
    cd textual-sticky-notes-tui
    ```

2.  **Create and Sync the Environment**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    This command:

    -Creates a virtual environment
        
    -Installs dependencies from pyproject.toml
        
    -Uses the lockfile for reproducible installs



3.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    uv run python src/main.py
    ```

# Notes
    No manual venv activation required

    No direct pip install needed

    Fast, reproducible, and modern Python workflow

## Global Installation (Linux)

For Linux users, the project includes a helper script (`manage.sh`) that installs the application system-wide to `/usr/local/bin`. This allows you to launch the application from any terminal window by simply typing its name.

### Installation

1.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x manage.sh
    ```

2.  **Install globally:**
    Since this installs to a system directory, root privileges are required.
    ```bash
    sudo ./manage.sh install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    Once installed, you can start the app from anywhere (no sudo required):
    ```bash
    stickynotes
    ```

### Uninstallation

To remove the application command from your system:

```bash
sudo ./manage.sh uninstall
```

## Usage & Keybindings

Once the application is running, you can use the following keys to interact with the interface.

## Priority & Organization

Sticky Notes TUI allows you to categorize the urgency of your tasks. When editing a note (`e`), you can select one of the following levels:

1.  **Trivial** (Default)
2.  **Low**
3.  **Medium**
4.  **High**
5.  **Critical**

### Icons & Visuals
Notes display visual icons corresponding to their priority level and pin status.
* **Pinned Notes:** Display a heavier border and a pin icon in the title.
* **Priority Icons:** Higher priorities display distinct glyphs in the header.

## Configuration & Storage

The application uses an intelligent storage system that respects your operating system's standards. You do not need to configure anything; it just works.

**Data Location:**
* **Linux:** `~/.local/share/sticky-notes/notes.json` (XDG Base Directory)
* **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/StickyNotes/notes.json`
* **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\StickyNotes\notes.json`

The data is saved in a human-readable JSON format, allowing for easy backup or manual inspection if necessary.

## CLI Tool

# Add a session summary note
python src/cli.py add -t "Session Summary" -c "Tasks done..." --session-note --project "MyProject"

# List recent notes
python src/cli.py list --limit 5

# Search notes
python src/cli.py search "keyword"
```
